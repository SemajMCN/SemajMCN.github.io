## CPSC 120

* ### lab 6 part 2

    Lab 6 part 2 was BlackJack. It was interesting to make something so complicated like a gamblers game. I enjoyed seeing the patterns being made as i work made me more comfortable in creating longer lines of code.

* ### lab 8 part 2

    Lab 8 part 2 was creating an average from arguments. Calculations made by the computer from my code is very rewarding. Knowing the equations for hard calculations makes me feel intelligent. And having the computer do the hard work makes me work smarter not harder.

* ### lab 4 part 1

    Lab 4 part 1 was a conversion calculator for ML, TSP, TBSP, OZ, and Cups. I enjoyed the versatility that can be created from one input. The volume was converted into 5 different units.
